## Presentation for LD4

While creating and editing Wikipedia pages, I found two problems with similar solutions. First, many existing Wikipedia pages are not connected to the correct Wikidata page, causing two separate items and confusing the linked data. Second, linked data is often incomplete. To address this problem, I created two scripts that access Wikipedia information to see what Wikidata pages might be combined or enriched. This session reviews my work as a lay coder to use the Wikipedia API to update, create, and enrich Wikidata as a Linked Data system.
